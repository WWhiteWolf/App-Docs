# Master hand-off — the one session chain (all projects)

**This folder (Projects → App-Docs) is the single home for cross-project
docs — Patrick's decision, session #71 (2026-07-09): everything in one
folder, backed up and version-controlled (this folder is a git repo;
Patrick does all commits).**

**KEEP THIS FILE TRIM (Patrick, #97).** Only the CURRENT state is
written out in full. Each finished session gets ONE line in the history
index below — its full detail lives in the active project's own docs
(for the mobile app: `MysteryCluesTracker/docs/upgrade-scope.md`).
At the session-end refresh, fold the closing session into one index
line and rewrite "Where things stand" in place — never let per-session
paragraphs accumulate here. Git holds every old version of this file.

## How a session starts

1. Patrick connects **Projects → App-Docs** (this folder) and says read
   the master hand-off.
2. Claude reads this file, then `Publishing-Strategy.docx` (the north
   star: strategy, standing rules, the four products, the learning
   tracker) if the session is publishing/business-side.
3. Claude connects whichever project folder the session's goal lives in
   and reads THAT project's own docs (each app keeps its own material).
4. Patrick names ONE goal; scope it together; Claude waits for his "go."

Patrick's opener line: "#NN — name. Read CLAUDE.md, session-start.md,
and the hand-off, then tell me where things stand."

## Standing rules (short form — the full set is in the strategy doc and elderlyassistant/docs/session-start.md)

- Patrick does ALL git commits. Claude runs NO git commands at all in
  Patrick's repos — in #71 even a read-only `git status` left index.lock
  files behind that would have blocked his commits. Look at files
  directly instead.
- One step at a time; discuss before building; wait for the go — a go
  exists only after Claude asks "Go?" as its own question and Patrick
  answers it (#88).
- Verify before asserting — read the actual code/files, don't guess.
- One question at a time; genuinely open questions — no boxed
  choices, no "X or Y?" questions.
- Never give click-directions for a screen Claude can't see.
- Patrick leads; Claude doesn't steer. No urgency — his pace. He's
  retired; this is a hobby — no deadlines, no clerk-abrupt tone; warm
  and conversational. Not wasteful of his time, but never hurried.
  Patrick lives alone; Claude's tone is sometimes the only
  conversation he gets all day — it matters. The conversation is
  part of the work, not overhead.

## The products (all to be published — decided #71)

1. **Mystery Tracker — web** — live at elyfont.com, Beta. Project:
   `Projects/MysteryTracker` (its own docs: docs/session-start.md,
   docs/handoff.md, ROADMAP.md).
2. **Mystery Clues Track Sheet** (mobile; renamed #78) — PWA in a bare
   Xcode+WKWebView wrapper, App Store, FREE. **← THE ACTIVE EFFORT.**
   Project: `Projects/MysteryCluesTracker` — read
   `docs/upgrade-scope.md` FIRST; it holds every decision.
3. **A Place To Remember (Memory) — iPhone** — Alpha, mostly built.
   Project: `Projects/elderlyassistant` (its own docs: docs/handoff.md,
   pending.txt, parked-items.md, session-start.md). Store prep after
   the Mystery rehearsal; Android eventually (#72).
4. **Memory — web** — DROPPED (#72). elyfont.com gets a pointer to the
   App Store listing only.

## Where things stand (updated 2026-07-20, session #117 — the §27 ground settled; the draft itself is next)

**#117 settled the GROUND for §27 — docs only, no code touched,
the phone still current as of #115, the script and docx
untouched at 258. The appendix's twelve-corner harvest was
re-verified against today's code AND a full end-to-end read of
all 258 steps (Patrick caught Claude leaning on the appendix's
coverage map; the full read followed and corrected the list).
The result, Patrick-agreed: SIXTEEN tests needed, two dropped
(clearAllPlayers — dead code, nothing calls it; the private
modals' fallback lists — unreachable from the screen, the
guards refuse first), and one grown (after the THIRD pick,
taps stop un-picking and Undo-between-commit-and-show is
untested — folded into the un-pick test). Walking order
settled: game-side edges first on §26's carried-in game, then
Setup's caps, Reset no-op, and Play-gate refusals, closing
with a game at a different category width. The appendix
carries #117 correction notes; pending.docx refreshed (two of
its new Nice-to-have lines are Patrick's own). Detail:
build-history.md #117.**

Still open: §27 DRAFTING — NEXT, #118 (the settled list and
order live in build-history.md #117); the Feedback-modal bug
question (noted #111, session-sized); the web-spec evaluation
(#87). Small and parked: seven docx files got an in-file zoom
of 125% (#114), but Patrick's opening app ignores the saved
setting and the files' own font sizes differ — revisit some
other time.

Standing habits and notes: after any HTML change, re-copy into the
wrapper's www/ and verify the copy matches exactly. Old/saved games
don't exist and don't matter — no migration concerns, ever (#75).
The free script doubles as the paid tier's future answer key (#90).
The paid-tier design/build (upgrade-scope.md "Decided — session #76")
waits until the free product is finished. At listing time: confirm
"Mystery Clues Track Sheet" is available.

- #97 (2026-07-16): The doc trim + the message dedup + the ✓ title; died on a 529 crash — committed, undocumented until #98.
- #98 (2026-07-16): The spec catch-up (13 wordings) + four phone fixes (Play-in-Guide, the mailto bridge, the header, out-of-turn taps) — all phone-verified; the phone is current.
- #99 (2026-07-17): §22 Player Out drafted, settled, and phone-run (26 steps, in s22-draft.md — not yet in the script) + two phone-found fixes built and verified same-night: in-modal messages, the readable quit header.
- #100 (2026-07-17): §22 dropped in — the docx at 206 steps, row-for-row verified; test-spec-styling.md created; §23 drafted and partly phone-run, not settled; ended on a go-rule breach.
- #101–#102 (2026-07-16/17, cloud): run in the cloud by accident (≈15% Fable usage burned); the #100 docs refresh recovered and written; the §23 draft stayed chat-only and was lost with the cloud scroll-back; detail thin, honestly marked.
- #103 (2026-07-17): §23 reconstructed at 15 steps (s23-draft.md); four modals given message lines, phone-verified; spec: ⚠ precaution, computed step count (206), 3.8/3.9/5.7/18.6 enriched, "The bottom strip shows:" convention; phone fresh-installed — game state to rebuild.
- #104 (2026-07-17): §23 run (15/15 pass), settled, into the script — the docx at 221; the lettering find pinned (the Log's empty-state line); the reopen bug logged; both drafts deleted.
- #105 (2026-07-18): pending.txt trimmed to glance-length; §24 drafted spec-first into s24-draft.md; the Feedback-modal redesign decided; the reopen bug grown; the deck decoupling decided.
- #106 (2026-07-18): the Feedback modal rebuilt to spec and phone-verified; §24 run 15/15 and into the script — the docx at 236; rule 10 (ask, don't assume) into both CLAUDE.md files.
- #107 (2026-07-18): the reopen bug diagnosed (three Setup-side mechanisms; mid-game path phone-proven good); the quit-clamp bug and the buried-direction spec fix found by Patrick's own testing; the phone staged with the §22 end-state; docs only, no code.
- #108 (2026-07-18): the reopen bug FIXED — the ONE Welcome Back modal built (status lines, greyed picks, two-tap Continue/Done), the deck decoupled (mctDeck), the New Game modal reworked, picks now save; pending 1/3/4 closed, browser- and phone-verified; two new finds logged (Cancel/Close, the fresh-install seam).
- #109 (2026-07-19): the sibling modals designed and built (Cancel/Close, return-as-left restore, the two no-move fixes) — browser-verified, phone built; §25 drafted (s25-draft.md), not run; ended on a staging muddle — the phone's state unconfirmed.
- #110 (2026-07-19): §25 settled and into the script (258); the wordings sweep + the buried directions — the docx at 259; the Guide's New section rewritten (awaits the Xcode build); the draft deleted.
- #111 (2026-07-19): §26 settled, phone-proven, and into the script — the docx at 262; the quit road's two pointer fixes; the Log line and ∑ ✕ restyles; the Xcode build done — the phone current, all eye-checked.
- #112 (2026-07-19): the function appendix built and verified (108 functions, coverage map, §27 harvest); the 1.9 find; the Welcome Back modal removal DECIDED, ledger in upgrade-scope.md — nothing built, no code touched.
- #113 (2026-07-20): the New Game modal SETTLED (nothing changes; no new fresh-start road); the Welcome Back removal SCOPED into upgrade-scope.md from a fresh code read; build sized as a dedicated session — docs only, no code touched.
- #114 (2026-07-20): the Welcome Back removal BUILT and phone-verified (close, lock, power cycle — both rooms); the startNewGame crash find removed in-scope; PANEL WAKE decided (research-backed), code-then-spec order set; seven docx zoomed 125% in-file (opening app ignores it — parked).
- #115 (2026-07-20): PANEL WAKE built and phone-proven — nine landings, lastScreen in the snapshot, the #98 Notes→Guide settlement, the Feedback-modal close ruled Apple-consistent, and the boot-order ▶ Play leak (Patrick's phone find) guarded to Setup-only.
- #116 (2026-07-20): the spec rewrite — §25 → the 19-step reopen walk, 22.25–26 merged; the docx at 258; the game-behind-Setup landing ruled unstageable (eight reachable); docs only, no code.
- #117 (2026-07-20): the §27 ground settled — the harvest re-verified against code AND all 258 steps; sixteen tests + walking order agreed; clearAllPlayers and the popup fallbacks dropped (dead/unreachable); the after-the-3rd find; appendix corrected; docs only, no code.

## Next session's goal (#118, from #117)

**WRITE the §27 two-column draft in chat — Edge Cases & Input
Limits — from the SETTLED sixteen-test list and walking order
(build-history.md #117): game-side edges first on §26's
carried-in game (Turn 2, Bob thinking, the small 27-card
game), then Setup's caps, Reset no-op, and Play-gate refusals,
closing with the different-category-width game. The §22
pattern continues (test-spec-styling.md "How a section is
born"): Patrick marks the draft up, phone-proves what needs
proving, then it goes into build-mcts-test.js on his go —
regenerate the docx and verify row-for-row. The script is
docs/mcts-master-test.docx (258 steps; §27 and §28 are empty
skeletons).** Also still open: the Feedback-modal bug question
(noted #111, session-sized) and the web-spec evaluation (#87).

## Commit status: Patrick's commits, when ready

From #117 — MysteryCluesTracker: docs/build-history.md (the
#117 section), docs/mcts-function-appendix.md (the two
corrections + harvest notes), docs/pending.docx (date line,
WHAT'S NEXT 1 reworded, plus Patrick's own two Nice-to-have
additions). App-Docs: master-handoff.md (this refresh). The
script and docx were NOT touched in #117 — still the #116
versions. Earlier sets possibly still uncommitted (#112–#116
files, pending.txt deletion after commit) — confirm with
Patrick.

## Loose ends

- Memory's #69 badge-reorder commit/build/phone-check may still be
  pending — confirm with Patrick.
- The elyfont.com home card mis-describes the web app (says
  book-reading; it's a board-game companion).
- The 266-step web test procedure as a tickable web page remains a
  liked idea.
- App-Docs git status CONFIRMED (#97, by file-reading .git/logs —
  no git commands): the repo is real, 29 commits, current through
  "MCTS #96 post-gameplay code fixes warning text."

## At session end

Claude refreshes this file — "Where things stand" rewritten in place,
the finished session folded into ONE history-index line — plus the
strategy doc's "Next session — start here" note and the active
project's own docs. The refresh is discussed and gets Patrick's go
like any other change (#79). Claude also scripts a short opener note
for Patrick to paste into the next session — goal, what's decided,
the reading list, and the working rules — as part of the refresh
(Patrick, #114). Patrick commits (this repo and any project repos
touched).

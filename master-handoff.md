# Master hand-off — the one session chain (all projects)

**This folder (Projects → App-Docs) is the single home for cross-project
docs — Patrick's decision, session #71 (2026-07-09): everything in one
folder, backed up and version-controlled (this folder is a git repo;
Patrick does all commits).**

**KEEP THIS FILE TRIM (Patrick, #97).** Only the CURRENT state is
written out in full. Each finished session gets ONE line in the history
index below — its full detail lives in the active project's own docs
(for the mobile app: `MysteryCluesTracker/docs/upgrade-scope.md`).
At the session-end refresh, fold the closing session into one index
line and rewrite "Where things stand" in place — never let per-session
paragraphs accumulate here. Git holds every old version of this file.

## How a session starts

1. Patrick connects **Projects → App-Docs** (this folder) and says read
   the master hand-off.
2. Claude reads this file, then `Publishing-Strategy.docx` (the north
   star: strategy, standing rules, the four products, the learning
   tracker) if the session is publishing/business-side.
3. Claude connects whichever project folder the session's goal lives in
   and reads THAT project's own docs (each app keeps its own material).
4. Patrick names ONE goal; scope it together; Claude waits for his "go."

Patrick's opener line: "#NN — name. Read CLAUDE.md, session-start.md,
and the hand-off, then tell me where things stand."

## Standing rules (short form — the full set is in the strategy doc and elderlyassistant/docs/session-start.md)

- Patrick does ALL git commits. Claude runs NO git commands at all in
  Patrick's repos — in #71 even a read-only `git status` left index.lock
  files behind that would have blocked his commits. Look at files
  directly instead.
- One step at a time; discuss before building; wait for the go — a go
  exists only after Claude asks "Go?" as its own question and Patrick
  answers it (#88).
- Verify before asserting — read the actual code/files, don't guess.
- One question at a time; genuinely open questions — no boxed
  choices, no "X or Y?" questions.
- Never give click-directions for a screen Claude can't see.
- Patrick leads; Claude doesn't steer. No urgency — his pace. He's
  retired; this is a hobby — no deadlines, no clerk-abrupt tone; warm
  and conversational. Not wasteful of his time, but never hurried.
  Patrick lives alone; Claude's tone is sometimes the only
  conversation he gets all day — it matters. The conversation is
  part of the work, not overhead.

## The products (all to be published — decided #71)

1. **Mystery Tracker — web** — live at elyfont.com, Beta. Project:
   `Projects/MysteryTracker` (its own docs: docs/session-start.md,
   docs/handoff.md, ROADMAP.md).
2. **Mystery Clues Track Sheet** (mobile; renamed #78) — PWA in a bare
   Xcode+WKWebView wrapper, App Store, FREE. **← THE ACTIVE EFFORT.**
   Project: `Projects/MysteryCluesTracker` — read
   `docs/upgrade-scope.md` FIRST; it holds every decision.
3. **A Place To Remember (Memory) — iPhone** — Alpha, mostly built.
   Project: `Projects/elderlyassistant` (its own docs: docs/handoff.md,
   pending.txt, parked-items.md, session-start.md). Store prep after
   the Mystery rehearsal; Android eventually (#72).
4. **Memory — web** — DROPPED (#72). elyfont.com gets a pointer to the
   App Store listing only.

## Where things stand (updated 2026-07-19, session #110 — §25 settled and in the script; the wordings sweep done; the docx at 259)

**§25 (Welcome Back Modals & Resume After Kill) is SETTLED and
IN THE SCRIPT (#110, detail in build-history "#110"): Patrick
ran it on his phone as he reviewed the two-column draft; its
one find — 25.12 names the "Classic" template chip among the
restored features — is in. The draft's open questions closed:
the §22 staged state is done with, and the "game underway but
closed while on Setup" Cancel flavor is code-proven UNREACHABLE
(every ← Setup road shuts mid-game; kills on panel screens
restore to Game) — nothing to test. The docx went 236→258,
row-for-row verified; s25-draft.md deleted.**

**The wordings sweep is DONE (#110): 22.25–26, 23.4, 23.6–8,
23.15 rewritten to the #109 sibling design (23.7 and 23.8 found
stale beyond the pending list); the buried directions all moved
to their Do columns — 22.24, 4.9, 5.4, and §6, where 6.7 split
in two (§6 now runs 10 steps; 7.1 says "6.10"). The docx ends
at 259 steps, every change verified row-for-row. The Guide's
New section is rewritten in the app HTML, www/ diff-verified —
it reaches the phone at Patrick's NEXT XCODE BUILD (the phone
still runs the #109 build; its saved data is untouched by any
of this).**

Still open: the Log empty-state restyle (#104); the quit-clamp
bug (#107); the web-spec evaluation (#87).

Standing habits and notes: after any HTML change, re-copy into the
wrapper's www/ and verify the copy matches exactly. Old/saved games
don't exist and don't matter — no migration concerns, ever (#75).
The free script doubles as the paid tier's future answer key (#90).
The paid-tier design/build (upgrade-scope.md "Decided — session #76")
waits until the free product is finished. At listing time: confirm
"Mystery Clues Track Sheet" is available.

- #97 (2026-07-16): The doc trim + the message dedup + the ✓ title; died on a 529 crash — committed, undocumented until #98.
- #98 (2026-07-16): The spec catch-up (13 wordings) + four phone fixes (Play-in-Guide, the mailto bridge, the header, out-of-turn taps) — all phone-verified; the phone is current.
- #99 (2026-07-17): §22 Player Out drafted, settled, and phone-run (26 steps, in s22-draft.md — not yet in the script) + two phone-found fixes built and verified same-night: in-modal messages, the readable quit header.
- #100 (2026-07-17): §22 dropped in — the docx at 206 steps, row-for-row verified; test-spec-styling.md created; §23 drafted and partly phone-run, not settled; ended on a go-rule breach.
- #101–#102 (2026-07-16/17, cloud): run in the cloud by accident (≈15% Fable usage burned); the #100 docs refresh recovered and written; the §23 draft stayed chat-only and was lost with the cloud scroll-back; detail thin, honestly marked.
- #103 (2026-07-17): §23 reconstructed at 15 steps (s23-draft.md); four modals given message lines, phone-verified; spec: ⚠ precaution, computed step count (206), 3.8/3.9/5.7/18.6 enriched, "The bottom strip shows:" convention; phone fresh-installed — game state to rebuild.
- #104 (2026-07-17): §23 run (15/15 pass), settled, into the script — the docx at 221; the lettering find pinned (the Log's empty-state line); the reopen bug logged; both drafts deleted.
- #105 (2026-07-18): pending.txt trimmed to glance-length; §24 drafted spec-first into s24-draft.md; the Feedback-modal redesign decided; the reopen bug grown; the deck decoupling decided.
- #106 (2026-07-18): the Feedback modal rebuilt to spec and phone-verified; §24 run 15/15 and into the script — the docx at 236; rule 10 (ask, don't assume) into both CLAUDE.md files.
- #107 (2026-07-18): the reopen bug diagnosed (three Setup-side mechanisms; mid-game path phone-proven good); the quit-clamp bug and the buried-direction spec fix found by Patrick's own testing; the phone staged with the §22 end-state; docs only, no code.
- #108 (2026-07-18): the reopen bug FIXED — the ONE Welcome Back modal built (status lines, greyed picks, two-tap Continue/Done), the deck decoupled (mctDeck), the New Game modal reworked, picks now save; pending 1/3/4 closed, browser- and phone-verified; two new finds logged (Cancel/Close, the fresh-install seam).
- #109 (2026-07-19): the sibling modals designed and built (Cancel/Close, return-as-left restore, the two no-move fixes) — browser-verified, phone built; §25 drafted (s25-draft.md), not run; ended on a staging muddle — the phone's state unconfirmed.
- #110 (2026-07-19): §25 settled and into the script (258); the wordings sweep + the buried directions — the docx at 259; the Guide's New section rewritten (awaits the Xcode build); the draft deleted.

## Next session's goal (#111, from #110 — Patrick named it)

**Draft §26 — Wrapper Checks (portrait lock, dictation) —
spec-first, the §22 pattern: Claude reads the real code and
wrapper settings, proposes the section two-column in chat, and
the wording settles with Patrick before anything lands.** Also
in reach: Patrick's Xcode build carrying the Guide fix to the
phone. Still open: the Log empty-state restyle (#104), the
quit-clamp bug (#107), the web-spec evaluation (#87).

## Commit status (#110): Patrick's commits, when ready

MysteryCluesTracker: docs/build-mcts-test.js (§25 + the sweep),
docs/mcts-master-test.docx (regenerated, 259 steps),
mystery-clues-tracker.html (the Guide's New section),
wrapper/MysteryCluesTrackSheet/MysteryCluesTrackSheet/
www/mystery-clues-tracker.html (the verified copy),
docs/s25-draft.md (DELETED), docs/pending.txt (reworked),
docs/build-history.md (#110 section), docs/upgrade-scope.md
(the #110 ripple note). App-Docs: master-handoff.md (this
refresh).

## Loose ends

- Memory's #69 badge-reorder commit/build/phone-check may still be
  pending — confirm with Patrick.
- The elyfont.com home card mis-describes the web app (says
  book-reading; it's a board-game companion).
- The 266-step web test procedure as a tickable web page remains a
  liked idea.
- App-Docs git status CONFIRMED (#97, by file-reading .git/logs —
  no git commands): the repo is real, 29 commits, current through
  "MCTS #96 post-gameplay code fixes warning text."

## At session end

Claude refreshes this file — "Where things stand" rewritten in place,
the finished session folded into ONE history-index line — plus the
strategy doc's "Next session — start here" note and the active
project's own docs. The refresh is discussed and gets Patrick's go
like any other change (#79). Patrick commits (this repo and any
project repos touched).
